# MongoDB Kafka Connector

## The MongoDB Kafka source connector guide

An [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) [connect source connector](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connect) for 
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

For more information about configuring connectors in general see the 
[official Confluent documentation](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/managing/configuring.html).

### MongoDB Source

Kafka records are generated from [change stream event documents](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/changeStreams/). Change streams can observe
changes at the _collection_, _database_ or _client_ level.

Data is read from MongoDB using the configuration connection as specified in the 
[connection string](http://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.10/javadoc/com/mongodb/ConnectionString.html).

**Note:** Change streams require a replicaSet or a sharded cluster using replicaSets.

Currently, only JSON strings are supported as the output.

**Note:** Kafka defaults to a 1MB message size. If the JSON string size of the change stream document is greater that 1MB then you will need
to configure Kafka to handle larger sized documents.  See this [stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21020347/how-can-i-send-large-messages-with-kafka-over-15mb)
for more information.

#### Event Document Format

The following document represents all possible fields that a change stream response document can have:

```
{
   _id : { <BSON Object> },
   "operationType" : "<operation>",
   "fullDocument" : { <document> },
   "ns" : {
      "db" : "<database>",
      "coll" : "<collection"
   },
   "to" : {
      "db" : "<database>",
      "coll" : "<collection"
   },
   "documentKey" : { "_id" : <value> },
   "updateDescription" : {
      "updatedFields" : { <document> },
      "removedFields" : [ "<field>", ... ]
   }
   "clusterTime" : <Timestamp>,
   "txnNumber" : <NumberLong>,
   "lsid" : {
      "id" : <UUID>,
      "uid" : <BinData>
   }
}
```

| copy.existing               | Copy existing data from all the collections being used as the source then add any changes after. It should be noted that the reading of all the data during the copy and then the subsequent change stream events may produce duplicated events. During the copy, clients can make changes to the data in MongoDB, which may be represented both by the copying process and the change stream. However, as the change stream events are idempotent the changes can be applied so that the data is eventually consistent. Renaming a collection during the copying process is not supported. | boolean | false                                                     |                                                | medium     |

### Custom pipelines

The following example can be used to only observe inserted files:

```properties
pipeline=[{"$match": {"operationType": "insert"}}]
```

_Note:_ MongoDB requires all change stream documents to include the resume token - the top level `_id` field.

### Publishing the changed documents only

Due to the restriction of requiring the resume token, a special configuration option has been added that allows users to only publish the 
actual documents after inserts, replaces or updates.

```properties
publish.full.document.only=true
```

This will automatically configure `change.stream.full.document=updateLookup` and will only publish events that contain a `fullDocument` field.

### Topic naming convention

The MongoDB Kafka Source connector will publish events to topics using the events namespace. For example, an insert into the 'data' collection 
in the 'test' database will publish to a topic called: 'test.data'.

The following example, will set the topic prefix to be 'mongo':

```properties
topic.prefix=mongo
```

In this case changes to the 'data' collection in the 'test' database will published to a topic called: 'mongo.test.data'.

### Copy existing data

The MongoDB Kafka Source connector can be configured to copy existing data from namespaces on to their given topic as insert events before broadcasting change stream events.
It should be noted that the reading of all the data during the copy and then the subsequent change stream events may produce duplicated events. During the copy, clients can make 
changes to the data in MongoDB, which may be represented both by the copying process and the change stream. However, as the change stream events are idempotent the changes can be 
applied so that the data is eventually consistent. Renaming a collection during the copying process is not supported.

The following example, will copy all collections from the `example` database into topics and then broadcast any changes to the data in those collections.

```properties
database=example
copy.existing=true
```
